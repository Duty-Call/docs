  - ‚òëÔ∏è Failed (network errors)
  - ‚òê Voicemail (optional)

**Example Retry Logic:**
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 1 hour ‚Üí Retry if No Answer or Busy
Attempt 3: Wait 4 hours ‚Üí Retry if No Answer or Busy
Max 3 attempts, then mark as Failed
```

**Step 5: Schedule Campaign**

**Run Immediately:**
- Click **"Start Now"**
- Campaign begins dialing within 1 minute

**Schedule for Later:**
1. Select **"Schedule"** tab
2. Choose start date/time
3. Set timezone (defaults to organization timezone)
4. Click **"Schedule Campaign"**

**Recurring Campaigns:**

## For Admins: Campaign System Configuration

### System-Wide Campaign Settings

**Navigate to:** Administration ‚Üí Voice Channel Setup ‚Üí Campaign Settings

**Global Configuration:**
- **Max Concurrent Campaigns**: Limit per organization (default: 10)
- **Max Concurrent Calls**: Twilio API limit (default: 100)
- **Default Retry Attempts**: System-wide default (default: 3)
- **Default Retry Delay**: Time between retries (default: 1 hour)
- **Call Timeout**: Seconds before marking no-answer (default: 30)

### Twilio Configuration for Campaigns

**Required Settings:**
1. **Twilio Account SID** - From Twilio Console
2. **Twilio Auth Token** - From Twilio Console
3. **Twilio Phone Number** - Outbound caller ID
4. **TwiML App SID** - For WebRTC (if routing to agents)
5. **Campaign Webhook URL** - Callback for call events

**Webhook Endpoints:**

**Campaign Initiate:**
```
POST https://yourapp.com/api/voice/campaign/initiate
```
Called when campaign starts a call. Returns TwiML.

**Campaign Status:**
```
POST https://yourapp.com/api/voice/campaign/status
```
Receives call outcome (completed, failed, no-answer, busy).

**Campaign Recording (if enabled):**
```
POST https://yourapp.com/api/voice/campaign/recording
```
Receives recording URL when call ends.

### TwiML Configuration

**Basic Campaign TwiML (Play & Hangup):**
```xml
<Response>
  <Say voice="alice" language="en-US">
    Hello, this is a message from {{COMPANY_NAME}}.
    {{CAMPAIGN_MESSAGE}}
  </Say>
  <Hangup/>
</Response>
```

**Campaign TwiML with Agent Routing:**
```xml
<Response>
  <Say voice="alice">
    Please hold while we connect you to an agent.
  </Say>
  <Enqueue waitUrl="/api/voice/queue/wait-music">
    {{QUEUE_NAME}}
  </Enqueue>
</Response>
```

**Dynamic TwiML (from Database):**
```php
public function campaignTwiML(Request $request)
{
    $campaign = Campaign::findByCampaignSid($request->CallSid);

    if ($campaign->audio_url) {
        // Use uploaded audio file
        return response()->xml([
            'Play' => $campaign->audio_url,
            'Hangup' => null
        ]);
    } else {
        // Use Text-to-Speech
        return response()->xml([
            'Say' => [
                '_attributes' => [
                    'voice' => $campaign->tts_voice,
                    'language' => $campaign->tts_language
                ],
                '_value' => $campaign->tts_message
            ],
            'Hangup' => null
        ]);
    }
}
```

### Campaign Dialing Logic

**Backend Campaign Processor (Laravel Example):**

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Campaign;
use App\Models\CampaignCall;
use Twilio\Rest\Client as TwilioClient;

class CampaignDialer
{
    protected $twilio;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->twilio = new TwilioClient(
            config('twilio.account_sid'),
            config('twilio.auth_token')
        );
    }

    /**
     * Process active campaigns and make calls
     */
    public function processCampaigns()
    {
        $activeCampaigns = Campaign::active()->get();

        foreach ($activeCampaigns as $campaign) {
            $this->dialCampaignContacts($campaign);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Dial contacts for a specific campaign
     */
    protected function dialCampaignContacts(Campaign $campaign)
    {
        // Get pending contacts (not yet called or ready for retry)
        $contacts = $campaign->contacts()
            ->where(function($q) {
                $q->whereNull('last_call_attempt')
                  ->orWhere('retry_at', '<=', now());
            })
            ->limit(100) // Batch size
            ->get();

        foreach ($contacts as $contact) {
            $this->makeCall($campaign, $contact);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Make individual call via Twilio API
     */
    protected function makeCall(Campaign $campaign, Contact $contact)
    {
        try {
            $call = $this->twilio->calls->create(
                $contact->phone, // To
                $campaign->twilio_number, // From
                [
                    'url' => route('voice.campaign.twiml', ['campaign' => $campaign->id]),
                    'statusCallback' => route('voice.campaign.status'),
                    'statusCallbackEvent' => ['completed', 'failed', 'no-answer', 'busy'],
                    'timeout' => $campaign->call_timeout ?? 30,
                ]
            );

            // Log call attempt
            CampaignCall::create([
                'campaign_id' => $campaign->id,
                'contact_id' => $contact->id,
                'call_sid' => $call->sid,
                'status' => 'initiated',
                'attempt_number' => $contact->call_attempts + 1
            ]);

        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            // Log error and schedule retry if applicable
            $this->handleCallError($campaign, $contact, $e);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Handle call outcome from Twilio webhook
     */
    public function handleCallStatus(Request $request)
    {
        $callLog = CampaignCall::where('call_sid', $request->CallSid)->first();

        $callLog->update([
            'status' => $request->CallStatus,
            'duration' => $request->CallDuration ?? 0,
            'completed_at' => now()
        ]);

        // Schedule retry if applicable
        if ($this->shouldRetry($callLog)) {
            $this->scheduleRetry($callLog);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Determine if call should be retried
     */
    protected function shouldRetry(CampaignCall $call): bool
    {
        $campaign = $call->campaign;
        $contact = $call->contact;

        // Check max attempts not exceeded
        if ($contact->call_attempts >= $campaign->max_retry_attempts) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check if status qualifies for retry
        $retryStatuses = $campaign->retry_conditions ?? ['no-answer', 'busy', 'failed'];
        return in_array($call->status, $retryStatuses);
    }

    /**
     * Schedule contact for retry
     */
    protected function scheduleRetry(CampaignCall $call)
    {
        $campaign = $call->campaign;
        $retryDelay = $campaign->retry_delay ?? 3600; // Default 1 hour

        $call->contact->update([
            'retry_at' => now()->addSeconds($retryDelay),
            'call_attempts' => $call->contact->call_attempts + 1
        ]);
    }
}
```

**Scheduled Task (Laravel Scheduler):**
```php
// In app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // Process campaigns every minute
    $schedule->call(function () {
        app(CampaignDialer::class)->processCampaigns();
    })->everyMinute();
}
```

### Monitoring & Performance

**System Health Checks:**
1. Navigate to **Administration** ‚Üí **System Health** ‚Üí **Campaigns**
2. Monitor:
   - Active campaigns count
   - Calls in progress
   - Twilio API latency
   - Error rate
   - Queue depth (pending calls)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **API Latency**: Twilio API response time (target: &lt;200ms)
- **Success Rate**: % of calls that connect (target: &gt;70%)
- **Error Rate**: % of failed API calls (target: &lt;5%)
- **Processing Speed**: Calls per minute

**Scaling Considerations:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use queue workers for campaign processing
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Twilio API rate limits (varies by account)
- **Database Optimization**: Index campaign_calls table on status, retry_at

### Compliance & Legal

**Call Recording Configuration:**
1. Toggle **"Record Campaign Calls"** ‚Üí ON
2. Add recording consent to TwiML:
```xml
<Say>This call may be recorded for quality assurance.</Say>
```
3. Set retention period per compliance requirements
4. Configure storage (S3 bucket with encryption)

**TCPA Compliance (US):**
- Maintain internal Do Not Call list
- Check against DNC before dialing
- Provide opt-out mechanism in call flow
- Log consent records for litigation protection

**Data Retention:**
- Call logs: Retain per industry requirements (90 days - 7 years)
- Recordings: Auto-delete after retention period
- Contact lists: Export before deletion if needed

**Learn more:** [Compliance & Retention](/administration/data-management/compliance-retention)

### Troubleshooting Admin Issues

**Campaigns not starting system-wide:**
1. Check Laravel scheduler is running (`php artisan schedule:work`)
2. Verify Twilio credentials are valid
3. Check Twilio account balance
4. Review error logs: `storage/logs/campaign-errors.log`

**High error rate (&gt;10%):**
1. Check Twilio API status: https://status.twilio.com
2. Verify webhook URLs are reachable (test with cURL)
3. Check database connection pool (may be exhausted)
4. Review campaign retry logic (may be too aggressive)

**Audio playback issues:**
1. Verify audio file URLs are publicly accessible
2. Check audio format (MP3/WAV only)
3. Test TTS voice availability in Twilio Console
4. Review TwiML syntax for errors

### Cost Optimization

**Reduce Twilio Costs:**
- Set appropriate call timeout (30s recommended)
- Use TTS instead of audio files when possible (cheaper)
- Limit retry attempts (don't exceed 3)
- Monitor and stop campaigns with high failure rates
- Use Twilio's cheaper Edge Locations if available

**Budget Monitoring:**
1. Set up billing alerts in Twilio Console
2. Track cost per campaign in Analytics
3. Calculate ROI (conversion value vs. call cost)
4. Review monthly Twilio invoice for anomalies
