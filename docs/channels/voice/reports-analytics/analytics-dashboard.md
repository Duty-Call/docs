## For Agents: Personal Performance Analytics

As an Agent, the Analytics Dashboard shows **your personal performance only**. This helps you track your own productivity, identify areas for improvement, and monitor your success.

### What You See

**Overview Tab:**
- Your total calls (this period)
- Your personal call volume metrics
- Account age

**Voice Tab (Your Data Only):**
- Your call count (inbound + outbound)
- Your success rate (completed vs failed)
- Your average call duration
- Your total talk time
- Your call status breakdown

### What You Cannot See

The dashboard is scoped to **your data only**. You will NOT see:
- ‚ùå Team or department performance
- ‚ùå Other agents' call data
- ‚ùå Campaign management statistics
- ‚ùå Organization usage metrics (email/SMS quotas)
- ‚ùå System health information
- ‚ùå Export functionality (restricted to Manager+)

### Why Limited Access?

**Data Minimization**: You only access data relevant to your role (GDPR/CCPA compliance principle)

**Privacy Protection**: Other agents' performance data is protected from peer viewing

**Focus**: Removes distractions from comparison to others - focus on your own improvement

**Security**: Reduces risk of sensitive data exposure

### How to Use Analytics for Self-Improvement

**Daily Routine:**
1. Log in to DutyCall
2. Click **"Analytics"** in sidebar
3. Check your **Voice tab**:
   - What's my success rate today? (Target: &gt;80%)
   - How many calls have I handled?
   - What's my average call duration?

**What Good Performance Looks Like:**
- **Success Rate**: &gt;80% calls completed successfully
- **Average Duration**: Consistent with your team's target (ask your manager)
- **Status Breakdown**: Low failed/no-answer rates

**If You See Issues:**
- **Success rate &lt;80%**: Review call handling technique, check if customers are answering
- **Very short durations**: May indicate missed calls or technical issues
- **High failed rate**: Check your phone/headset connection, verify WebRTC is working

### Quick Actions

**Refresh Your Data:**
- Click the **"Refresh"** button (top right) to see latest stats
- Dashboard updates in real-time based on your recent calls

**Review Call History:**
- For detailed call-by-call records, visit [Call History](/channels/voice/reports-analytics/call-history)
- Filter by date, direction, status, or contact

**Get Help:**
- If numbers look wrong, contact your manager
- For technical issues, check [Troubleshooting](/voice/inbound/agent/troubleshooting)

### Understanding Your Metrics

**Total Calls:**
- Count of all calls (inbound + outbound) you handled
- Higher is generally better (shows activity level)

**Success Rate:**
- Percentage of calls that completed successfully
- Formula: (Successful Calls / Total Calls) √ó 100
- Target: &gt;80% for healthy performance

**Average Duration:**
- Mean length of your calls in minutes/seconds
- Should be consistent with your role expectations
- Very short = potential connection issues
- Very long = may need efficiency coaching (ask manager)

**Total Talk Time:**
- Sum of all call durations
- Shows your total productive time on calls
- Use to understand your daily workload

### Tips for Agents

**Daily Check (30 seconds):**
- Morning: Check yesterday's success rate
- End of day: Review today's call count and duration

**Weekly Review (5 minutes):**
- Compare this week vs last week
- Look for trends (improving or declining?)
- Identify patterns in your peak performance times

**Goal Setting:**
- Set personal targets (e.g., "achieve 85% success rate this week")
- Track progress daily
- Celebrate improvements

**When to Ask for Help:**
- Success rate drops below 70%
- Average duration significantly changes (¬±50%)
- You see failed calls but don't know why
- Numbers don't match your perception of performance

---

**Remember**: These analytics are for YOUR benefit - use them to improve, not to stress. Everyone has off days.

```

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
import { useVoiceAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useAnalytics';

function VoiceAnalyticsComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useVoiceAnalytics();

  if (isLoading) return <LoadingCard />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage />;

  const { volume_breakdown, success_metrics } = data.data;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Total Calls: {volume_breakdown.total_calls}</h2>
      <p>Success Rate: {success_metrics.overall_success_rate}%</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

#### UI Components

**File:** `frontend/src/components/analytics/index.ts`

**Available Components:**

```tsx

### Role-Based Scoping Logic

**Implementation:** `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AnalyticsController.php`

**Method:** `applyScopingToVoiceQuery()` (lines 682-715)

**Logic:**
```php
switch ($user->role) {
    case 'agent':
        // Show only their own calls
        $query->where('user_id', $user->id);
        break;

    case 'dept_manager':
        // Get departments this manager oversees
        $deptIds = DB::table('department_agents')
            ->where('agent_id', $user->id)
            ->pluck('department_id');

        if ($deptIds->isNotEmpty()) {
            // Show department team data
            $agentIds = DB::table('department_agents')
                ->whereIn('department_id', $deptIds)
                ->pluck('agent_id');
            $query->whereIn('user_id', $agentIds);
        }
        // Else: No departments - show all (fallback)
        break;

    case 'account_admin':
        // Show organization-wide data
        $query->where('customer_id', $user->customer_id);
        break;

    case 'super_admin':
        // No scoping - see everything
        break;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Agent scoping**: `user_id` filter
- **Manager scoping**: Department-based via `department_agents` pivot table
- **Manager fallback**: If no departments assigned, show all data (for testing/setup)
- **Admin scoping**: `customer_id` filter (multi-tenant)
- **Super Admin**: No filters applied

---

### Performance Optimization

**Memory Profiling:**
```php
$this->profiler->startProfiling('analytics_voice');
$this->profiler->checkpoint('volume_calculated');
$this->profiler->endProfiling();
```

**Add profiling header:**
```bash
GET /api/analytics/voice?profile=1
X-Memory-Profile: {"checkpoints":[...]}
```

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Use `count()` queries instead of loading collections
- Select only needed columns
- Apply database-level `groupBy` for aggregations
- Limit results at query level (not collection level)
- Eager load relationships to avoid N+1 queries

---

### Error Handling

**Standard Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to retrieve voice analytics",
  "error": "Internal server error"
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- `200`: Success
- `401`: Unauthenticated (missing/invalid token)
- `403`: Unauthorized (insufficient permissions)
- `500`: Server error

**Logging:**
```php
Log::error('Voice analytics failed: ' . $e->getMessage(), [
    'exception' => $e,
    'user_id' => auth()->id()
]);
```

---

### Testing the Analytics Dashboard

**Quick Test:**
1. Log in with Manager+ account
2. Navigate to **Analytics** in sidebar
3. Should see full dashboard with 5 tabs (or 4 if not Super Admin)
4. Click each tab to verify data loads
5. Test **Refresh** button
6. Test **Export** button on Campaigns tab

**API Testing:**
```bash
# Get voice analytics
curl -X GET "https://api.dutycall.net/api/analytics/voice?date_from=2025-10-01&date_to=2025-10-11" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```
