# Agent Quick Start

Get started handling inbound calls as a DutyCall agent.

## Your Role

As an agent, you:
- Handle inbound calls from the queue
- Set your availability status
- Complete wrap-up tasks after calls
- View your call history

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the Queue Dashboard

After logging in:
1. Navigate to **Queue Dashboard**
2. You'll see your availability status and waiting calls

### 2. Set Yourself Available

Before receiving calls:
1. Toggle your status to **Available**
2. Your browser will initialize the Twilio device
3. You'll start seeing calls in the queue

### 3. Accept Your First Call

When a call arrives:

1. Call appears in "Waiting Calls" list
2. Click **Accept Call**
3. Your browser dials into the queue
4. You'll hear the caller when connected
5. Badge shows "In-Progress" (green)

See [Accepting Calls](/voice/inbound/agent/accepting-calls) for details.

### 4. Handle the Call

During the call:
- Use call controls (Hold, Transfer, Mute - coming soon)
- Click **End Call** when finished
- OR let the caller hang up first

### 5. Complete Wrap-Up

After either party hangs up:
- Badge shows "Wrap-up" (purple)
- Call UI stays visible
- Add notes or update CRM
- Click **End Call** to finish and return to available

See [Wrap-Up Workflow](/voice/inbound/agent/wrap-up-workflow) for details.

## Call Status Badges

- ðŸŸ¡ **Ringing** (Yellow): Call connecting
- ðŸŸ¢ **In-Progress** (Green): Active conversation
- ðŸŸ£ **Wrap-up** (Purple): Call ended, completing after-call work

## Tips

- Always complete wrap-up before taking next call
- Set yourself unavailable when on break
- Use wrap-up time to add call notes (coming soon)
