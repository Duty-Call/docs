# Data Management Overview

:::info Admin-Only Feature
Data Management features are only available to **Administrator** and **Super Administrator** roles. These tools provide access to raw data exports, compliance controls, and system-wide data governance.
:::

## What is Data Management?

Data Management provides administrator-level access to raw system data across all channels (Voice, Email, Chat, etc.) for compliance, auditing, integration, and data portability purposes.

This is **different from Reports & Analytics**, which provides processed insights and performance metrics for day-to-day operations.

### Reports & Analytics vs. Data Management

| Feature | Reports & Analytics | Data Management |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Performance monitoring, operational insights | Compliance, auditing, data portability |
| **Access** | All roles (filtered by permissions) | Admin-only |
| **Data Type** | Processed metrics and visualizations | Raw data exports |
| **Use Cases** | "How's my team performing?" | "Export all call records for Q4 audit" |
