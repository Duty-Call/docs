# Audit Logs

:::caution Coming Soon
This feature is currently under development. Documentation will be updated as the feature becomes available.
:::

## Overview

Audit Logs provide a comprehensive record of user activity, system changes, and data access across the DutyCall platform for security, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.

## Planned Capabilities

### User Activity Tracking
- **Authentication Events**: Login, logout, failed attempts
- **Data Access**: Who viewed or exported what data
- **Configuration Changes**: Settings modifications with before/after values
- **Permission Changes**: Role and access control updates

### System Event Logging
- **API Calls**: Track all programmatic access
- **Data Exports**: Record all bulk data downloads
- **Integrations**: Third-party system access
- **Security Events**: Anomalies, suspicious activity, policy violations

### Log Retention & Export
- **Searchable Interface**: Filter by user, action, date, resource
- **Long-Term Storage**: Retain audit logs per compliance requirements
- **Export Capabilities**: Download logs for external analysis
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifications for critical events

## Audit Log Fields

Each audit log entry will include:

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **User**: Who performed the action (username, role, IP address)
- **Action**: What was done (created, updated, deleted, exported, etc.)
- **Resource**: What was affected (call record, user account, setting, etc.)
- **Details**: Specific changes or parameters
- **Result**: Success or failure
- **Session ID**: Link to authentication session

## Use Cases

### Security & Compliance
- **SOC 2 / ISO 27001**: Demonstrate access controls and monitoring
- **HIPAA**: Track access to protected health information
- **Incident Response**: Investigate security events
- **Forensic Analysis**: Reconstruct timeline of events

### Operational Transparency
- **Change Tracking**: "Who changed this setting and when?"
- **Access Verification**: "Did this user access this data?"
- **Troubleshooting**: "What happened before the system behaved unexpectedly?"

### Legal & Regulatory
- **Evidence Preservation**: Support litigation or investigations
- **Compliance Audits**: Demonstrate proper controls to auditors
- **Data Subject Requests**: Prove compliance with privacy laws
