# Data Export

:::caution Coming Soon
This feature is currently under development. Documentation will be updated as the feature becomes available.
:::

## Overview

Data Export provides administrator-level access to raw data across all channels (Voice, Email, Chat, etc.) for compliance, auditing, and integration purposes.

:::info Access Restriction
This feature is **restricted to Manager and Administrator roles** (may become Admin-only in future releases). Agents cannot export data.
:::

## Why We Restrict Data Exports

Export capabilities are limited to Manager+ roles for critical business and security reasons:

### 1. Data Security & PII Protection
Call logs contain sensitive information:
- Customer phone numbers
- Personal identifying information (PII)
- Potentially regulated data (health info, financial details)

Bulk export access increases risk of unauthorized data exposure. Agents don't need this level of access for their daily work.

### 2. Competitive Intelligence Protection
Your call database is valuable business intelligence:
- Customer contact information
- Call patterns and engagement data
- Strategic business relationships

Limiting export access prevents scenarios like a departing agent exporting your entire customer database before leaving the company.

### 3. Regulatory Compliance (GDPR/CCPA)
Restricting data exports demonstrates compliance with data minimization principles:
- Only authorized personnel access sensitive data
- Reduced attack surface for data breaches
- Clear data governance controls
- Easier to defend in regulatory audits

### 4. Business Value Protection
This data is **gold** - it's strategic business intelligence, not operational data agents need for daily tasks:
- Customer insights and trends
- Performance benchmarks
- Revenue-generating contact lists
- Competitive advantages

### 5. Audit Trail & Accountability
Limiting exports to managers/admins makes it easier to:
- Track who exported what data and when
- Investigate potential data misuse
- Maintain chain of custody for compliance
- Respond to security incidents

**Bottom line**: Data export is a privileged operation requiring business justification and oversight.
