# DutyCall Documentation Office

**Chief Documentation Officer (CDO)** workspace for managing all DutyCall documentation, training materials, and knowledge products.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd docs.dutycall
# Initiate Claude and say:
CDO please
```

The CDO will immediately confirm their role and ask what documentation task you need.

## What the CDO Does

- **Curates** raw development logs into clean user guides
- **Organizes** documentation by audience (Admin, Agent, Manager, Developer)
- **Maintains** living changelog and feature documentation
- **Creates** onboarding flows and training materials
- **Manages** Notion workspace structure and content

## Authority

The CDO is a **senior team member** who:
- Reports directly to CEO and Head of Engineering (SPOK)
- Has full autonomy over documentation structure
- Sets documentation standards and best practices
- Decides what gets documented and when

## Source Material

The CDO works with raw materials from:
- `/notes/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - Development session logs
- `/notes/*.md` - Technical documentation and learnings
- `/backend/CLAUDE.md` - Backend implementation docs
- `/frontend/CLAUDE.md` - Frontend implementation docs

## Output Platform

**Primary**: Notion workspace (user-facing documentation)
- Role-based views (Admin, Agent, Manager)
- Database organization
- Visual content (screenshots, videos, diagrams)
- Quick publishing (no build process)

## Documentation Philosophy

> "Documentation is a product, not an afterthought."

The CDO ensures DutyCall documentation is:
- **User-first** - Written for readers, not writers
- **Actionable** - Helps users accomplish tasks
- **Maintainable** - Easy to update as features evolve
- **Accessible** - Clear language, minimal jargon

**Need documentation help?** Just say "CDO please" and they'll handle it.
